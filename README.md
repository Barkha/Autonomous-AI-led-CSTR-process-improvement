# Autonomous Systems with Bonsai

Contoso is world wide leader in gases, chemicals and services.  It's main factory creates 60% of the chemicals needed for industry and manufacturing as well as agriculture.

Contos has been going through a digital transformation and is looking to embrace AI and Autonomous systems for it's Chemial processing plant in order to improve both safety and optimize production. One of the primary target for optimization is the Chemical plant is a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is essentially a tank that has a stirring apparatus to continuously mix reactants inside. 

One of the concerns regarding this CSTR is an exothermic reaction, that produces heat, meaning the reactor temperature must be controlled to prevent thermal runaway, when the reactor becomes uncontrollably hot. The CSTR needs to operate under transient and steady state conditions. During continuous steady-state operation, the CSTR is producing a specified product. When the CSTR is starting up or transitioning to produce different output concentrations it is in transient state. The transient state is difficult to control to reach the target concentration of the product while preventing thermal runaway.


## Target Audience

AI Architects
AI Engineers
Data Scientists

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will work as a group to setup and configure a Bonsai Brain to manage the CSTR during both the steady state to optimize product and maintain heat, and the transient state to prevent thermal runaway or overheating.  This process will incluse completing the AI Spec sheet, deploying a simulator, and programing and training a Bonsai Brain using Inkling.  Note that a simulator for this workshop already exists.  Also note that the actual deployment of the brain is not covered in it's entirety.

At the end of this workshop, you will have learned to use the Bonsai Tool chain - including problem definition and use case definition using the AI Spec, Bonsai Platform using Inkling and using and deployin a simulator written in ??.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution for operating the CSTR .

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have gained insight on how best to take advantage of the new serverless wave by designing a highly scalable and cost-effective solution that requires very little code and virtually no infrastructure, compared to traditional hosted web applications and services.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.
